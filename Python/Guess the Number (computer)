    2. Guess the Number (computer)'''

''' Get the computer to generate a secret number using the random function in 
    the module 'random.'
    Kylie refers to python documentation, https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html, 
    which states: 
        random.randint(a, b)Â¶
        Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. 
        Alias for randrange(a, b+1). 
        Kylie says: "a and b are the parameters
        that we need to pass our arguments 
        (A value passed to a function (or method) when calling the function.) into
        a function to get the random number'''
import random

''' Define this function named guess and make x a parameter so that
    we can pass in the random number between 1 and x.'''
    
def guess(x):
    random_number = random.randint(1, x)
''' Next the user guesses a number, and we need a while loop
    to continue looping the function 'guess', until we get
    the correct answer.'''
    guess = 0 # so the loop doesn't stop.
    while guess != randtom_number:
        guess = input(f'Guess a number between 1 and {x}')
        '''Formatted string literals (also called f-strings for short) 
        let you include the value of Python expressions inside 
        a string by prefixing the string with f or F and writing expressions 
        as {expression}.'''
